# peytoncampbell.ca

Personal portfolio site for Peyton Campbell, built with React, TypeScript, Vite, and Tailwind CSS.

The site highlights full-stack product work, experience, education, GitHub activity, contact links, and a downloadable resume. It also includes a standalone Catan Settlement Optimizer at `/catan/`, an interactive board analysis tool for ranking strong opening settlement spots.

## Local Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The local dev server usually runs at `http://127.0.0.1:5174/` or the next available Vite port.

## Build

```bash
npm run build
```

The production output is written to `docs/` because GitHub Pages is configured to serve from `main` and `/docs`.

## Deployment

The repository is hosted at `peytoncampbell/peytoncampbell.ca` and publishes to:

- https://peytoncampbell.ca/
- https://peytoncampbell.ca/catan/

The custom domain is configured through the `CNAME` files in `public/` and `docs/`.

## Infrastructure

This is a static website hosted with GitHub Pages. The app is built with Vite, and the generated production files are committed to `docs/`. GitHub Pages serves that folder from the `main` branch.

Cloudflare manages the public DNS for `peytoncampbell.ca`. The domain routes traffic to the GitHub Pages site while Cloudflare handles DNS resolution, HTTPS, and edge-level routing for the custom domain. In practice:

- Source code lives in this GitHub repository.
- `npm run build` generates the static site into `docs/`.
- GitHub Pages serves the `docs/` folder.
- Cloudflare points `peytoncampbell.ca` at the GitHub Pages deployment.
- The `CNAME` files keep GitHub Pages attached to the custom domain.
